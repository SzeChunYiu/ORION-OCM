"""Ported from ORION tests/unit/kernel/test_hard_gates.py (commit adb97ec).

Import rewritten to ``ocm.constitution.hard_gates``. The two driver-wiring
tests at the end of the source file (``test_a_flat_run_does_not_close_while_a_
declared_gate_is_failed`` and ``..._with_an_unobserved_gate_is_unresolved_not_
closed``) are not ported: they exercise ORION's ``SelfDrivingDriver``, which
OCM does not vendor. Everything else is verbatim.
