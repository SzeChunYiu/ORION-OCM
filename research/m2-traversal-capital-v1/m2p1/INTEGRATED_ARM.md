# `CONTINUED_OCM` — the integrated developmental controller, as one arm

Every OCM-specific win in this lane came from a separate research script compared to
the parent on its own. The mission's Q4 (composition) and the cross-domain spine need
them as **one controller** inside the runner, so every future run carries it:

```text
CONTINUED_OCM = MDL selection → probe (depth from history) → task-statement rule on a
                miss → D_live liveness on the probe hit-rate
```

`learn_generator`, `validate_generator`, `solve` and `verify_solution` are still the
registered units; every success is externally verified after a real OS-process restart;
the controller reads only the task statement, solved history and the outcomes of
charged actions. Everything it needs is computed in the dev phase and stored in
`dev_state.ocm_controller` (rule cells, probe depth, β, liveness window).

## Smoke test — E6, 16 targets

| arm | ladder | mean `B` |
|---|---|---|
| **`CONTINUED_OCM`** | 16 | **154.4** |
| `PARENT_WITH_MDL` (same library, interleave) | 16 | 307.9 |
| `ORDINARY_ADAPTIVE_PARENT` (frequency library) | 16 | 2 121.5 |
| `RESET` | 16 | 4 187.2 |

The controller runs end-to-end and beats the parent holding the **same library** by
**50 %** — the guided-first probe reaching in `g` what the interleave reaches in `2g`.
It is the first arm in this programme that is OCM-specific, deployable, leak-free, and
better than the strongest parent on a uniform ecology.

## A negative that fixed the depth rule

The first "auto" depth was *max tiling-token count over solved history* — a coverage
rule. On FOREIGN_M1 with the 16-fragment library (`T = 20`) it chose depth 4,
`β = 168 420`, and came out **+22 % worse than RESET** (served 92.5 %, hits landing late),
where depth 3 had given −26 % vs the parent.

Coverage is the wrong objective; the correct one is **expected cost on history**:

```text
for each candidate depth D:
    solved training program with tiling count d_i and paid baseline index b_i costs
        d_i ≤ D :  Σ_{j<d_i} T^j + T^{d_i}/2      (its guided position)
        d_i > D :  β_D + b_i                      (a miss, then fall back)
choose the D with the lowest mean
```

Every quantity is history: `b_i` is the slot count the organism actually paid when it
solved that target. This is the MDL-over-frequency lesson one level up — utility, not
coverage — and it is now the controller's rule.

**Registered before running:** FOREIGN_M1 picks depth 3 (→ ≈ 14.8 k); D2 picks depth 4
(→ ≈ 22.7 k); FV8 with the MDL library picks 4 only if MDL shrinks `T` enough, otherwise
stays negative.

## Scope

One smoke ecology for the integrated arm; the cost-depth rule is under test on three.
Liveness (window 8, hit-rate floor 0.25, periodic re-probe) has not yet been exercised
by a shift in this arm — the plasticity result stands separately.
